	<h4>The Herstory</h4>
	<div id="About-me">
		<p>I am a Detroiter from the Eastside! The money side, some may call it! I grew up wanting to be an astronaut from the age of 6 years old. 
		My mother always supplied me with literature that aided in my dreams. </p>

	<h4>The Engineer</h4>
	<div id="Mechanical">
		<p>The road to becoming an astronaut led me down several fascinating paths. I learned how fly airplanes in high school and went to college for engineering. 
		In December 2018, I graduated from Lawrence Tech with a bachelors of Mechanical Engineering.

	<p>
	I wanted to expand my horizons by learning how to program. I heard about GC through one of their alumni, I signed up for a few of their free coding classes. I really enjoyed making programs and the logic behind computer programming.
	I found more online free classes and talked to family/friends about their experience programming. This led me to apply for the January cohort for backend Java!
